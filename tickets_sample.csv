## Instructions:

1. **Save** this content as `tickets_sample.csv`
2. **Go to** "Upload Tickets" tab in the frontend
3. **Select** the CSV file
4. **Check** "Auto-execute matching runbooks" if you want automatic execution
5. **Click** "Upload Tickets"

The system will:
- Create tickets from CSV rows
- Analyze each ticket for false positives
- Search for matching runbooks
- Auto-execute if confidence ≥0.8 (if enabled)
- Return list of created tickets with status

## What Happens:

1. **Ticket Created** → Status: `analyzing`
2. **False Positive Detected** → Status: `closed`
3. **True Positive + Runbook Found** → Status: `in_progress` → Execution starts
4. **True Positive + No Runbook** → Status: `analyzing` → Manual runbook selection needed

## To Generate Pending Approvals:

1. Upload tickets with matching runbooks
2. Ensure runbooks have approval steps (`requires_approval: true`)
3. Check "Agent Dashboard" for pending approvals
