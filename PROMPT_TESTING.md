## Example Test Case

### Variables:
- **issue_description**: `server is running slow and users are complaining of timeouts`
- **service**: `server`
- **env**: `prod`
- **risk**: `low`
- **context**: `Server performance issues typically involve high CPU usage, memory exhaustion, or I/O bottlenecks. Check system metrics, identify runaway processes, and consider service restarts.`

## What to Look For in Responses

1. **Complete troubleshooting steps**: Should have 5-10+ steps covering diagnosis, resolution, verification
2. **Proper YAML format**: All lists (inputs, steps, postchecks) must start with `- `
3. **No markdown**: Should start directly with `runbook_id:` not `` ```yaml ``
4. **Relevant commands**: Steps should be specific to the issue (e.g., CPU/memory for slow server)
5. **Inputs match usage**: Input parameters should be referenced in steps with `{{variable}}`
6. **Prechecks and postchecks**: Should include validation before and after

## Feedback Format

When you test, note:
- ‚úÖ What works well
- ‚ùå What's missing (e.g., "Only 3 steps, need more diagnostic steps")
- üîß What to change (e.g., "Add more network-related checks for timeout issues")

Then we'll iterate on the prompt!
